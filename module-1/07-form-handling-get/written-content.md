Ingredients


1 cup white sugar

0.5 cup unsalted butter, softened

2 large eggs

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

3 ripe bananas, mashed

1 teaspoon cinnamon

2 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 pinch salt

0.5 cup old-fashioned oats

0.5 cup chopped walnuts

---

Directions

Preheat the oven to 165 ÂºC. Line 12 muffin cups with papers liners.

Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Beat first egg into butter mixture until completely blended; beat in vanilla extract with remaining egg.

Mix bananas, milk, and cinnamon together in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; slowly stir into banana-butter mixture until batter is just mixed. Fold oats and walnuts into batter.

Scoop batter into the muffin cups using a large ice-cream scoop.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers of the muffins comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes.
