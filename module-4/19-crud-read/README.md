# CRUD Applications

## What is a CRUD Application?

A CRUD application uses **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete functionality for managing data. These operations are the basic building blocks of most dynamic websites and web applications.

Each of these operations corresponds to a specific type of SQL statement.

## CRUD Operations

1. **Create**  
   - Adding new data to the system.
   - These are usually `INSERT` statements. 
   - Examples: writing a new Facebook status; adding a post to Instagram; uploading a video to TikTok.

2. **Read**  
   - Viewing or retrieving data from the system.
   - These are usually `SELECT` statements.   
   - Examples: looking at Google search results; browsing the Reddit front page; looking at the most popular books on Amazon. 

3. **Update**  
   - Modifying existing data.
   - These are usually `UPDATE` statements.   
   - Examples: editing a blog post on tumblr; changing your user bio; fixing a typo in a Discord message.

4. **Delete**  
   - Removing data from the system.
   - These are usually `DELETE` statements. 
   - Examples: deleting a tweet; closing an account; emptying your spam folder.

In this lesson, we will start by setting up our new application, using the table from our previous demos. Our goal will be to have a simple index page where users can see all of the records currently in our database. 

This page will be largely procedural, which means that the user won't be able to alter any of the data (yet). However, in the next few lessons, we'll slowly add additional functionality.
